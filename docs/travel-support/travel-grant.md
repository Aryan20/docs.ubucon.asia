# Travel grant

For those who have difficulties raising fund for travel to host city(or country) for attending UbuCon Asia, The Committee provides travel grant for selected applicants. Grant that can be applied for are provided in 2 categories.

## Travel grant for round trip
The committee provide funding for round trip between your home and hosting city(or country). Which is usually flight, train, ferry or other inter-city or international trasnportation. To minimize risks and provide funding for as much people as possible, The committee provides funding for your round trip as reimbursement after the event finished. Which means, even if you got your grant approval, you will need to book your round trip ticket with your own money first. Then we'll provide resimbursement for that after the event. 

## Accomodations support
The committee provide accomodation during the event period. In case the committee have secured large block of accomodations in advance, you will be assigned to room and receive confirmation for your accomodation along with some instructions. There could be also cases the committe did not secured rooms before. In that case, the committee will ask you to your book accomodation with your own money then provide reimbursement after the event.

## Grant priority
