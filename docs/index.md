## About UbuCon & UbuCon Asia

### UbuCon (Ubuntu Conference)

Today, there are two large scale event happening annually in Ubuntu community. One is Ubuntu Summit which is largely driven by people at Canonical(The company behind Ubuntu) and some from Ubuntu community and gathers people from all around the world. The other one is UbuCon (Ubuntu Conference). Unlike Ubuntu Summit, UbuCons are fully drived by the community rather Canonical. It is also usually organized for specific continent, country or region which makes local communities key stake holders of the event.

### UbuCon Asia

UbuCon Asia is an event organized by Ubuntu Communities in Asia. Itâ€™s for everyone who involved with or interested in Ubuntu, Linux and other Free and Open source technologies. It is also a place for Ubuntu people from Asia to connect, learn, and share their knowlegdes each other.

The first UbuCon Asia was held in 2021 as a fully virtual event (due to COVID-19). Then we switched to in-person (or hybrid with some live streams) to gather Ubuntu folks around Asia in-person, face-to-face.
