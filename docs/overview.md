# Event overview

## Conference content

UbuCon Asia usually runs 3 rooms simultaniosly for conference sessions. One of them is usually a large auditorium that can handle about 200~300 participants for Keynote,  talks and Panel discussions that would be inspiring many participants. The other rooms are small classroom that can handle 20~40 participants for breakout sessions: Talks, Workshops or BoFs 

Most sessions are academic-style conference presentation with some Q&A with audiences. English is mostly used to give presentations. But depending on the country, sometime there are also some sessions in native language of the host city. 

Most sessions are at least recorded as videos, if possible we also live stream online so that people could also join the event remotely. After the event, session videos are also edited and published on UbuCon Asia YouTube channel and other video channels if available.

## Social events
We usually try to organize conference dinner and group tour.

Conference dinner is usually organized at least once right after the closing of Day 1 programs with around 40~80 participants scale. If possible, another one could be also organized after Day 2 program. It can be either organized on-site (in the venue) by bringing catering, Or off-site (Usually restaurants or banquet room near the venue). Usually event staffs(Organizers and volunteers), speakers and sponsors joins the dinner. And if there's more seats avilable, few attendees also join the dinner sometimes.

Group tour is usually organized next day of Day 2 with 15~25 participants scale. It could be either a half-day or full day group tour schedule. Details are usually up to local team. They can either prepare through travel agency, or just plan group tour themselves. The tour schedules usually includes visiting some famous attractions and meals (lunch and dinner)


## Travel grants

Travel grant is one of the largest parts that takes event budget plan. Through travel grant, the conference usually covers flight expenses of overseas speakers.
